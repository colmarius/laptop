## Laptop

Laptop is a script to set up my OS X laptop for web development. Forked from [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop).

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Requirements

* [OS X Mavericks (10.9)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567)
* [OS X Yosemite (10.10)](https://www.apple.com/osx/)

## Install

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colmarius/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

## Debugging

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself.
